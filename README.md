### I’m a data scientist trying to make sense of our data pollution.

###  :key: Why data science?
The world has too many unanswered questions and challenges to leave this critical reasoning to only a few specialists. All educated members of society can build the tool set to reason about data.

🔭 I’m currently working at Homer Learning, where we are trying to improve early learning outcomes for children with our mobile applications.

🌱 I’m currently learning:
  - how to modularize and reuse my ds/ml tasks. 🔄
  - [DATA8 from Berkeley](https://inferentialthinking.com/index.html) 🔄
  - [DATA100 from Berkeley](https://ds100.org/) ➡️
  
  Key:
    - ➡️: To Do
    - 🔄: In progress
    - ✅: Completed
  
🤔 I’m looking for help with general data science tools and utlities that make pre processing and data transformations easier.

💬 Ask me about data in general. i.e. How might we explore large challeges like climate change / education with data? No question is a dumb question.
